# TP-077: Supervisor Recovery Tools — Status

**Current Step:** Step 4: Documentation & Delivery
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Step 1 Plan (revised R001):**
1. Register `orch_retry_task` tool (taskId: string, required) in extension.ts following existing tool pattern.
2. Resolve stateRoot via execCtx (workspaceRoot → repoRoot → ctx.cwd) consistent with engine persistence.
3. Load persisted batch state from disk; validate task exists and status is `failed` or `stalled`.
4. Reject if batch is actively running (launching/executing/merging/planning) — no IPC path, document in tool response.
5. Reset task fields: status→pending, exitReason→"", doneFileFound→false, startedAt→null, endedAt→null, exitDiagnostic→undefined, partialProgressCommits→undefined, partialProgressBranch→undefined.
6. Decrement failedTasks counter. Transition batch phase: if was "failed"→"stopped" (resumable with force), keep "stopped"/"paused" as-is.
7. Save via saveBatchState with atomic write.
8. Sync main-thread orchBatchState summary counters if batchId matches.
9. Return confirmation message with taskId, new status, and hint to call orch_resume(force=true).
