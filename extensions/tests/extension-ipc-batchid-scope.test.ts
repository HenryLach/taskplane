/**
 * Regression guard for issue #559: `ReferenceError: batchState is not defined`
 * crashes the orchestrator parent on the first IPC frame from the engine-worker.
 *
 * Root cause: TP-187 (#538) introduced `ipcBatchIdMatches(incomingBatchId)` and
 * a pair of stderr-logging template literals inside the supervisor's IPC
 * handler closure that all referenced `batchState.batchId`. The closure does
 * NOT bind a `batchState` variable — only `supervisorState` is in scope there
 * (declared at the same nesting level as `terminatedLanes` / `terminatedAgents`).
 * The crash fired the moment the engine-worker sent its first `lane-terminated`
 * or `lane-respawned` IPC, taking down EVERY batch.
 *
 * The crash slipped through because:
 *   - `node --experimental-strip-types` does not perform name-resolution
 *     checks; it only strips type annotations, leaving runtime ReferenceErrors
 *     to surface at IPC time.
 *   - The TP-187 in-batch tests mock the IPC handlers at a different layer
 *     (`engine-worker → supervisor` callbacks via `executeOrchBatch`'s deps
 *     parameter), bypassing the actual extension closure under fault.
 *
 * This test asserts BOTH:
 *   1. The buggy identifier `batchState.batchId` does NOT appear inside the
 *      lexical region between `let supervisorState = freshSupervisorState()`
 *      and the close of the lane-terminated/lane-respawned handler block(s).
 *      Other regions of extension.ts legitimately bind a different `batchState`
 *      via destructuring (e.g., `const batchState = lockResult.batchState;`)
 *      and use it correctly — those are out of scope for this guard.
 *   2. The closure-scope IPC helpers reference `supervisorState.batchId`,
 *      which is the actually-in-scope binding.
 *
 * If a future edit reverts to `batchState.batchId` inside the supervisor IPC
 * closure, this test fails with a clear pointer at the regression.
